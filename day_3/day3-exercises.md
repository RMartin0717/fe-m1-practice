## Chapters 13 and 15 on Boxes and layout

### Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.
- Border is what separates the edge of one box from the edge of another. Margin is the gaps between borders. Padding is the space between the border of a box and the content contained within it.

### For a CSS rule padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?
- In order: top, right, bottom, left.

### Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.
- Block-level and inline both refer to how elements are displayed. Block-level means that each element is stacked on top of one another and takes up the full horizontal space of the page. Inline means that the elements are on the same horizontal row.

### What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?
- Fixed positioning positions an element in relation to the browser window, outside of the normal flow of the page. Z-index is important because it determines which element will remain on top. For example, you would want your heading to have a higher z-index value than the paragraphs on the page so that the paragraphs don't cover the heading as the user scrolls.

### What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?
- With a fixed layout, the connects of the page do not change size as the user increases/decreases the size of the browser window and measurements tend to be in pixels. With a liquid layout, designs stretch/contract as the user increases/decreases the size of the browser and measurements tend to be in percentages.
