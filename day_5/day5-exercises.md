# JavaScript & JQuery

## Chapter 2 on Statements, Variables, Data Types, & Arrays

### How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?
- Use var followed by a name for the variable. Then either on the same line or on a new line starting with the variable name, an equal sign and the value assigned to the variable. Each statement should end with a semi-colon.
ex: ```var name = "Riley";```

### There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.
- a number is any positive or negative number. a string is characters contained in quotes. a boolean has a value of true or false.

### What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?
1. name must begin with letter, $ sign, or underscore, NOT a number (number can come later, just not first)
1. no - or .
1. cannot use keywords or reserved keywords
1. case sensitive
1. use a name that describes the kind of info that the variable stores
1. use camelCase

### How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?
- An array can store data that you can then run the same commands on for each value. You can access or reassign the value of a variable by using its index value

### What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
- An expression evaluates to a single value
- statements are instructions and each one starts on a new line

### What are three types of operators and how are they used?
- assignment operators (assign value to a variable)
- arithmetic operators (perform basic math)
- string operators (combine strings)
