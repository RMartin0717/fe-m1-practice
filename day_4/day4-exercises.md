# HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites

## Chapter 5 on Images HTML

### In an image element, why is the alt attribute important?
- The alt attribute provides alternative text to describe an image so that screen reader software can read it for the visually impaired and so that search engines may find it.

### What determines if an image element is inline or block?
- An image element is inline if it is on the same horizontal axis as text. This is done by including the image and text within the same paragraph element. An image element is block if it is coded within its own containing element and is viewed in the browser as not being horizontally in between other text or images on the page (unless floats are used)

### What are the benefits of jpg or png image file formats?
- A jpg file format is good for images that have many colors, such as photos. png is better for images with flat color, such as vector images and for images that have some transparency.

## Chapter 16 on Images CSS

### What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?
- In CSS, you can apply the same dimensions to other images with the same class.

### What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?
- An image sprite is an image that is used several times (such as a logo) and is useful because instead of a larger folder of images, the browser is able to load more quickly because it is accessing the same image multiple times.
