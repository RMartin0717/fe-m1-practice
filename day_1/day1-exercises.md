# HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites--Chapters 1 and 2 on Structure and Text

### On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
- HTML code creates the structure for web pages that a user interacts with.

### What is the difference between an element and a tag?
- A tag is the characters contained by a left-angle bracket and right-angle bracket. Two of these act as containers (opening and closing tags in which the closing tag also has a forward slash) for text. The characters inside of the brackets that indicate something about the content between the tags is the element. In <p>, p is the element within the tag.

### Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
- Attributes provide more information  about the contents of an element, such as the language of the text.

### Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
- The head element comes before the body and contains information about the page, such as the title.
- The title element contents are usually shown in the top of the browser or on the tab for that page.
- The body element contains everything that is shown in the main browser window.

### In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
- Click view -> developer -> view source

### List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
- <sup> superscript
- <br /> line break
- <strong> indicates strong importance, might be said with emphasis, by default renders in bold
- <abbr> goes around an abbreviation or acronym to include the full term. when user hovers over the abbreviation or acronyn, the full term is specified
- <s> indicates that something is no longer accurate/relevant, but should not be deleted, displayed with strikethrough

### What are empty elements?
- Empty elements are elements that do no have words between opening and closing tags. There is usually just one tag which includes a space and forward slash, such as with line breaks <br />.

### What is semantic markup?
-  Semantic markup is for describing the content of webpages more accurately, not for styling text. Programs such as screen readers and search engines use this to get extra information. Examples include <strong>, <em>, <address>, and <cite>.

### What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
- Many <div> elements have been replaced by new HTML5 layout elements that indicate the kind of content you will find in them.
1. <header> is used to contain the site name and the main navigation
1. <nav> is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as primary site navigation
1. <article> acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone. for example, if a page contains several articles, then each individual article would live inside its own <article> element. <article> elements can be nested inside each other, such as a blog post living inside one <article> element and each comment living inside its own child <article> element.
